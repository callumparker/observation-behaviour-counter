# Field Observation Behaviour Counter
A behaviour counting app created with Unity. It is used for observation studies to make counting people and their behaviours easier.

Requirements:
- Unity 5.6.2 or higher.
- Unity build tools for Android or iOS.

This app was created specifically to run on an Android device. However, it will probably work just fine on an iOS device thanks to the power of Unity's build tools! :-)
